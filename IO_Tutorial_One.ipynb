    "2.  **HTML** | HTML (Hypertext mark-up language) is plain text that is heavily \"marked up\" with tags (words inside of angle brackets).  Because HTML is typically used to build web pages, it is heavily engaged in layout and presentation -- not just content.  And because HTML was never really intended to be used in this fashion, it is now joined by dozens of auxillary languages, scripts, and objects -- all of which tend to get in your way while you work with HTML.\n",
    "3.  **.CSV** | The venerable comma-separated-values file is the workhorse of contemporary data science.  .CSV files (and those of its fraternal twin, .TSV, tab-separated-value) tend to do a great job delivering data with a minimal amount of cruft.  Their main drawback is that they are uncompressed.  It is not uncommon to find even powerful computers choking on unnecesssarily large .CSV files.\n",
    "4.  **.JSON** | Originating with the popular web programming language javascript, the JavaScript Object Notation is a simple, efficient, and remarkably popular format:  It makes all the other formats jealous.  Many professionals who work with data science toolsets have come to prefer .JSON over .XML, in part because it simply looks less intimidating.  While APIs tend to make their data available in both formats, JSON now tends to be the default.\n",
    "5.  **.XML** | The W3C describes the Extensible Markup Language (XML) as \"a simple, very flexible text format.\"  I would call that description \"overly optimistic.\"  When we have time, we can review some .XML files and you'll see why fewer and fewer institutions seem to be depending on it like they used to."

It will send you to the default directory listing:  If that is not where you want to store your Notebook files, then navigate to the place where you DO want to keep them.  Once you are satisfied that you are looking at the best directory for this purpose, go to the upper right hand of the browser window and choose the button/pulldown labeled NEW.  From the list it creates, choose Python 3.\n",

Let's make sure we're off to a good start:  Put that browser window aside (minimize it, hide it, etc.) and open up your operating system's native file browser (the one you use everyday:  OSX uses the Finder; Windows uses Explorer).  Navigate to the directory where your Jupyter notebook should be, and make sure it is, in fact, there.  Jupyter will have added a file extension to the filename, so it should look like this:\n",

BUT MacOS may automatically unzip it for you, without asking your permission.  This can make things confusing.  If so, use the folder MacOS unzipped -- if not, unzip the file yourself and drag that folder to the same place your notebook is stored."
