And though it isn't as flexible on the front-end (e.g., in terms of varying the colors of your maps, the density of given data, and so forth), it does give us a lot of opportunities to clutter their maps with our data.\n",

There are other tutorials that can walk you through that, or I can do it, too (if you ask nicely).\n",

    "Recall that to install anything, we've traditionally turned to a command line program called `conda` (named for Condaleeza Rice, former Secretary of State) (true story!).  `Conda` is a package manager -- a specialized bit of code that works with the native operating system to control how other programs get installed, and uninstalled, from your computer.  Most consumers have never heard of package-managers because most consumer-oriented software (think MS Word and Adobe Photoshop) is sold as \"self-contained.\"  Microsoft doesn't (usually) ask you to worry about the libraries and fonts and codecs and scripts that MS Word needs to run:  They tend to just dump it all on your harddrive at once and wish you luck.  \n",
    "\n",
    "That works -- in part -- because Microsoft and Adobe are capital-fueled behemoths who can afford to buy the rights to whatever software libraries their suites depend upon.  Smaller software producers -- for both better and worse -- work differently.  While Microsoft (for example) presents each piece of software it sells as self-contained, smaller developers -- especially in the open source community -- usually make clear that their software depends upon other open-source software.  What to us may appear as a single program, in other words, is usually a network of independently-developed programs."

    "\n",
    "That \"ease of use\" comes at a cost, though:  To do anything a user might ask of the program, VLC relies on *nearly 70 other software libraries and codecs*.  `libmatroska`, for example, handles the muxing and demuxing of popular .mkv files;  `libpng` knows how to read a .png; `taglib` can read .mp3 metadata; `Upnp` handles, well, 'plug-n-play' network configuration."

It will still begin the search with the same professionally-maintained software libraries we've used so far -- but if it can't find the programs there, it is going to look elsewhere: `conda-forge`.
