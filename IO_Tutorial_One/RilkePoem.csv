"Rilke,"
Archaic Bust of Apollo

transl. LeMasters (after S. Mitchell)

We cannot know his face and all the light
that ripened in his eyes. And yet his torso
"still glows like a gas lamp dimmed,"
"in which his gaze, now turned to low,"

holds fast and shines. Otherwise
"the curved breast could not dazzle you so, nor could"
a smile run through the placid hips and thighs
to that dark center where procreation flared.

Otherwise this stone would seem defaced
beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders
and would not glisten like a wild beastâ€™s fur:

"would not, from all the borders of itself,"
burst like a star: for here there is no angle from which
it does not see you. You must change your life.
